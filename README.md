# Code for: "Divide and rule: A practical overview of uncertainty propagation in the case of data disaggregation"

This is the code for reproducing the results for our study on “Divide
and rule: A practical overview of uncertainty propagation in the case of
data disaggregation” submitted to the Journal of Industrial Ecology
(JIE).

## Data required

To reproduce the results and run the scripts you need to download the
following data:

-   EXIOBASE V3.8.2 `IOT_2015_ixi.zip` and `MRSUT_2015.zip` from here:
    <https://zenodo.org/records/5589597>
-   Intermediate results from the article "“Estimating the uncertainty
    of the greenhouse gas emission accounts in Global Multi-Regional
    Input-Output analysis” available here (for details how those data
    was generated, see the paper and its code): 10.5281/zenodo.13806019
    . Download them and save them in the `./data` folder
